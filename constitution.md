# Constitution - Wedding RSVP App

> Governing principles, decision hierarchy, and quality guardrails for the Wedding RSVP application.

## 1. Purpose
Define durable, non-ephemeral rules that guide architectural, process, and quality decisions for our wedding RSVP platform. These principles are higher-order than transient tasks or implementation details and ensure consistent, maintainable, and secure development practices.

## 2. Core Principles
Each principle gets a stable ID (CONST-P#) for traceability from specs, plan items, tasks, and implementation decisions.

### CONST-P1: Modular Architecture First âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **MANDATORY MODULAR STRUCTURE**: Break everything into small, self-contained modules with single responsibilities
- **STRICT SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**: UI components NEVER handle business logic or API calls directly
- **FEATURE-BASED FOLDERS**: Organize by features (`auth`, `rsvp`, `admin`, `content`), not file types
- **CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**: Separate policy from implementation details - defer technology decisions
- âœ… Implemented: `src/features/` and `src/shared/` structure in place

### CONST-P2: AI-Driven Development Excellence âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **PLAN FIRST**: Spend 60-70% of time planning architecture, UI/UX, and task breakdown before coding
- **STRUCTURED PLANNING PROCESS**: Constitution â†’ Specification â†’ Plan â†’ Tasks â†’ Implementation
- **CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: Feed AI only relevant files/folders for current task
- **NEW CONVERSATIONS**: Start fresh AI conversations at natural breakpoints
- **MVP MINDSET**: Build simplest valuable version first, avoid scope creep
- **MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS**: Always ask AI for 2-3 approaches with pros/cons
- âœ… Implemented: Spec Kit process with constitution, specification, plan, tasks documents

### CONST-P3: Type Safety & Validation âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **STRICT TYPESCRIPT**: No `any` types allowed, comprehensive type definitions
- **ZOD VALIDATION**: All user inputs and API responses validated with Zod schemas
- **COMPILE-TIME SAFETY**: Catch errors at build time, not runtime
- **API CONTRACTS**: Type-safe API interfaces with proper error handling
- âœ… Implemented: Zod schemas for all data types, TypeScript strictness enforced

### CONST-P4: Code Quality & Consistency âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **LINTERS MANDATORY**: ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS linter configured and enforced
- **NAMING CONVENTIONS**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables, kebab-case for files
- **DRY PRINCIPLE**: No duplicate logic - create reusable utilities
- **SOLID PRINCIPLES**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **ZERO WARNINGS**: All lint errors and warnings must be resolved before merge
- âœ… Implemented: All lint errors resolved, successful production build

### CONST-P5: Security & Privacy by Default ðŸš§ PHASE 2
- **INPUT SANITIZATION**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs with Zod schemas
- **SECURE AUTHENTICATION**: JWT-based auth with httpOnly cookies, proper session management
- **AUTHORIZATION CHECKS**: Role-based access control on all protected routes
- **NO SECRETS IN CODE**: Use environment variables, never commit sensitive data
- **REGULAR SECURITY AUDITS**: Review critical code against security best practices
- ðŸš§ Planned: JWT authentication system, input validation, secure admin access

### CONST-P6: Testing & Quality Assurance ðŸš§ PHASE 3
- **UNIT TESTS REQUIRED**: Every core function must have unit tests
- **TDD FOR CRITICAL PATHS**: Test-driven development for auth, APIs, core features
- **MOCK EXTERNAL DEPS**: Mock databases, third-party APIs in tests

### CONST-P8: API First & Service Layer ðŸš§ PHASE 2
- **SERVICE LAYER PATTERN**: All API calls go through dedicated service functions
- **CUSTOM HOOKS**: Business logic isolated in custom hooks, not components
- **ERROR BOUNDARIES**: Implement error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- **LOADING STATES**: Every async operation has loading, success, and error states
- **API VERSIONING**: Prepare for future API changes with proper versioning

### CONST-P9: Performance & Scalability ðŸš§ PLANNED

- **HEALTH CHECKS**: Monitoring, logging, error tracking in production
- **BACKUP STRATEGIES**: Data backup and recovery procedures
- **SCALABILITY**: Prepared for traffic spikes and growth


## 3. Decision Hierarchy
1. **Constitution (this document)** â€“ Durable principles; changes require majority maintainer approval
2. **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** â€“ Architectural decisions; may supersede Plan entries; must cite impacted CONST-P#
3. **Plan (PLAN-#)** â€“ Evolving architectural blueprint; updated via PR referencing relevant ADR or SPEC
4. **Specification (SPEC-#)** â€“ User-facing requirements; drives Plan evolution
5. **Tasks (TASK-###)** â€“ Execution units implementing Plan/Spec items
6. **Code** â€“ Implementation detail; cannot silently diverge from higher layers
